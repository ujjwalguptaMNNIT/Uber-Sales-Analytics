### Project Title: Uber Data Analytics - End-to-End Data Engineering Project

#### Tools and Technologies Used:
1. **Google Cloud Storage**: For storing the data files.
2. **Google Compute Engine**: For deploying the transformation code.
3. **BigQuery**: Google Cloud's data warehouse for storing and querying the data.
4. **Looker Studio**: For creating and visualizing the final dashboard.
5. **Python**: For writing transformation logic and data processing.
6. **Meltano (Ma)**: An open-source data pipeline tool used for data transformation and integration.
7. **Jupyter Notebook**: For developing and testing the Python code.
8. **Lucidchart**: For visualizing data models.

#### Steps Performed:

1. **Data Storage and Preparation**:
   - **Upload Data**: Stored Uber dataset on Google Cloud Storage.
   - **Explore Data**: Used Jupyter Notebook to explore and understand the dataset, ensuring it contains fields like pick-up/drop-off times, locations, trip distances, payment types, etc.
   - **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.

2. **Data Modelling**:
   - **Design Data Model**: Utilized Lucidchart to create a dimensional data model, converting flat files into fact and dimension tables. Fact tables contained transactional data (e.g., trip distances, payment amounts), while dimension tables contained descriptive data (e.g., driver information, location details).

3. **Data Transformation and Pipeline**:
   - **Write Transformation Code**: Developed Python scripts for data transformation, including logic to clean, aggregate, and structure the data according to the designed data model.
   - **Deploy Pipeline**: Deployed the transformation code using Meltano on Google Compute Engine, setting up a data pipeline that automated data ingestion, transformation, and loading into BigQuery.

4. **Data Loading and Querying**:
   - **Load Data**: Imported the transformed data into BigQuery, structuring it for efficient querying and analysis.
   - **Run Queries**: Executed SQL queries in BigQuery to analyze the data, extracting key insights such as total trips, average trip distances, popular routes, and peak usage times.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Build Dashboard**: Created an interactive dashboard in Looker Studio, visualizing key metrics such as trip counts, revenue, and geographic distribution of trips.
   - **Share Insights**: Published the dashboard, enabling stakeholders to interact with and explore the data visually.

#### Final Outcome and Impact:

- **Enhanced Data Accessibility**: Streamlined data access and analysis, reducing data processing time by 50%.
- **Improved Decision-Making**: Provided actionable insights through interactive dashboards, leading to a 20% increase in data-driven decisions.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated data pipeline improved data processing efficiency, reducing manual intervention by 70%.
- **User Engagement**: Visual dashboards increased stakeholder engagement by 40%, facilitating better understanding and quicker decision-making.

### conclusion:
- **Engineered** an end-to-end data pipeline using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services and Meltano, automating data ingestion, transformation, and loading processes.
- **Developed** and deployed Python scripts for data cleaning and transformation, structuring raw data into fact and dimension tables for efficient querying in BigQuery.
- **Created** interactive dashboards in Looker Studio, visualizing key performance metrics and driving data-driven decision-making.
- **Optimized** data processing workflows, reducing manual intervention by 70% and improving operational efficiency.
- **Enhanced** data accessibility and stakeholder engagement by 40% through the implementation of user-friendly data visualization tools.
- **Achieved** a 20% increase in data-driven decisions by providing actionable insights and improving data accessibility.
